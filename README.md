# Reviung41 ZMK Configutation

The Reviung41 is a ergonmic-adjacent keyboard with an alternative layout.

[Kit used for my build, purchased from Little Keyboards](https://www.littlekeyboards.com/collections/reviung41-keyboard-kits)

Some minor adjustments from thee ZMK default includes remapping one of the `alt`keys to be a `gui` key for macos.
